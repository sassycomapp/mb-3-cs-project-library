# Mybizz CS — User Flows

**Authority:** Reference — defines the intended behaviour of every user flow in Mybizz CS. Each flow carries the feature number it belongs to (F-01 to F-37, as in `mb-3-cs-concept.md`). Where a technical fact here differs from `mb-3-cs-architecture-reference.md`, the architecture reference is correct.

## UF-01 Client registration and provisioning (F-03, F-34)

**New Client:**
1. Registers on the Mybizz website: business name, trade, owner name, owner email, the client's own domain.
2. Receives a confirmation email from Mybizz and confirms the email address.
3. Sets up the client's storage and domain settings, guided step by step on the registration page with a short video: opens a free Cloudflare account on the client's own email address, adds a payment method, switches R2 on, adds the client's domain to Cloudflare, and invites Mybizz's Cloudflare user as a member with the roles Cloudflare R2 Admin and DNS. The account is the client's and stays the client's.
4. Chooses the monthly plan or the annual plan, adds assisted setup if wanted, and pays the first month or the first year in Paddle's checkout. A client that arrived through a referral link finds the referral code filled in, and may type one otherwise; the form tells it that the referring client will see its business name and whether it has subscribed.

**System (App 5):**
5. Creates the client record and issues the client reference number.
6. Creates the client's database and the client's app `[client-name]-cs` from the current release image, with its `encryption_key` and Bearer token; the app builds its tables.
7. Accepts the client's Cloudflare invitation, creates the client's R2 bucket and a token that reaches that bucket only, and creates the client's Amazon SES tenant, domain identity and scoped AWS keys.

8. Stores the Bearer token and the client's Mybizz-side credentials.
9. Writes the bucket's keys and the AWS keys into the instance's Vault, and the SES SMTP credentials into the app's SMTP settings.
10. App 5 loads the sample data for the client's trade.
11. Creates the Owner account in the instance with `business_profile.onboarding_status = "in_progress"`.

**System:**
12. Sends the Owner a welcome email from Mybizz's own address with a link to set a password. No password is ever sent by email.

---

## UF-02 Owner onboarding (F-03)

Onboarding is a resumable wizard, separate from Settings, with a progress indicator and a short help video on every step. Each step saves when completed. See [[[default:specifications-global/spec-onboarding-implementation-plan|Mybizz CS Onboarding System - Engineering Plan]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-onboarding-implementation-plan.md).

1. **Owner sets a password** from the welcome link, enrols a FIDO2 second factor (a security key or the device's passkey) and signs in → the onboarding wizard opens with a welcome and the progress indicator.
2. **App language** — choose English, French, German, Spanish or Italian (the languages whose translation is complete); every later step and video follows the choice.
3. **Business profile** — link to Settings → Business Profile tab; the AI helper offers the first website text from the profile.
4. **Brand palette** — link to Settings → Brand Palette tab, with live preview.
5. **System currency** — select from the list and confirm; locked once the first booking or invoice exists.
6. **Legal acknowledgement** — read the critical excerpts, tick, confirm; recorded with a timestamp in the instance and in App 5.
7. **Payment gateway** — link to Settings → Payment Gateways: connect Stripe, optionally PayPal; secret keys go into the Vault; test mode on.
8. **Connect the domain** — the wizard shows the website and email records; App 5 writes them in the client's Cloudflare DNS (or the Owner copies them into another domain provider) and the wizard checks them until every one is live. Where the domain already receives email elsewhere, the wizard says that switching moves all the domain's email into the Team Inbox and asks the Owner to confirm. The Owner's personal address and the default sender address are created.
9. **Import contacts** — upload a CSV file exported from HubSpot, Mailchimp, Acuity or any other tool; the matching columns are filled in for the known tools; the Owner checks the mapping and imports; existing contacts with the same email are updated, not duplicated. The step can be skipped.
10. **Onboarding complete** → the Owner is taken to the Dashboard, where the sample data banner shows.

- **Bidirectional navigation:** the Settings form shows "Return to Onboarding" while onboarding is in progress.
- **Resume:** an Owner who leaves mid-way returns to the next unfinished step.
- **After onboarding:** Settings is used for all ongoing configuration (tabbed, role-governed). Credentials are changed only in the Vault (UF-04).
- **Help:** every step's help video opens from its tooltip; the Owner can request assisted setup through Help.

---

## UF-03 Staff invitation and sign-in (F-01, F-05)

1. Owner or Manager opens Settings → Users and Permissions → Invite.
2. Enters name, email and role (Manager, Admin or Staff); for Staff, assigns the services the provider delivers and sets the provider's schedule; chooses the invitee's personal email address on the client's domain and the desks the invitee belongs to (UF-39).
3. The invitee receives an email with a link to set a password.
4. The invitee enrols a second factor (authenticator app or security key), signs in and lands on the Dashboard, seeing only what the role allows.
5. Owner or Manager can change a role, deactivate or reactivate a user at any time; deactivated users cannot sign in.

---

## UF-04 Opening the Vault (F-02)

1. Owner opens Vault; if the last sign-in is older than five minutes, the Owner signs in again with password and second factor.
2. Enters the current code from the Vault's authenticator app (required every time; no remembered session). On the first open, the Owner enrols the authenticator from a QR code. A lost authenticator is reset by the Owner: Reset Vault code, then the emailed link, then a new enrolment (`sop-vault-recovery.md`).
3. Views, adds or replaces a credential (gateway keys, AWS keys, R2 keys).
4. Closes the Vault. The Owner receives an email recording the access.

---

## UF-05 Services appointment booking (F-11)

**Entry:** `/services`

1. Browse service categories.
2. Select a service — description, duration, price (in the display currency if set), providers, delivery mode.
3. Select a provider (a specific provider, or "any available") — photo, specialisations, availability.
4. Select date and time — calendar showing only available slots.
5. Select meeting type — at the business, video call or phone call (UF-06 covers the customer's location). A video call link is generated automatically.
6. Enter customer details (name, email, phone). Signed-in customers are pre-filled.
7. Complete the intake form if the service requires one.
8. Add appointment notes or special requests.
9. Review and pay — the payment option set on the service:
   - **Pay in full now**
   - **Pay a deposit now**, balance invoiced
   - **Pay on the day** — no payment now; invoiced at the appointment
   - **Invoice with payment terms** — no payment now; an invoice is issued with the service's payment terms (for example, 30 days)
   - A customer with a session package can **use a package session** instead (UF-10).
10. Confirmation — immediate confirmation email with a calendar invite attached; reminders 24 hours and 1 hour before, each with the call link where relevant.

- **Post-confirmation:** offer a recurring appointment (weekly, every two weeks, monthly).
- **Status:** a booking paid now, or booked on pay on the day or invoice terms, is confirmed at once. A booking whose online payment has not yet succeeded is pending (UF-38).
- **Clash prevention:** the server checks the slot again at the moment of confirmation; if the slot was taken, the customer is shown the nearest free slots.
- **Performance:** the flow pre-loads data and batches related operations to keep server calls few ([[[default:adr-global/adr-form-architecture-and-state|Form Architecture and State Management]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-form-architecture-and-state.md) ADR). Date and money logic runs on the server only ([[[default:adr-global/adr-anvil-platform-constraints|Anvil Platform Constraints and Design Boundaries]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-anvil-platform-constraints.md) ADR).
- **System:** the booking creates or updates the customer's contact (F-17) and appears on the provider's calendar.

---

## UF-06 Booking at the customer's location (F-11)

As UF-05, with these differences:

- At step 5 the customer chooses **at my location** and enters the address.
- Available slots at step 4 allow the service's travel time before and after, against the provider's other bookings.
- The address appears on the booking, the confirmation and the provider's calendar entry.

---

## UF-07 Group session booking (F-11)

**Set-up (Owner or Manager):** Services → a group service → add a session: date, time, provider, place limit, location or call link.

**Customer:**
1. Selects the group service and sees the upcoming sessions with places left.
2. Selects a session and the number of places (one per person attending).
3. Enters details, pays by the service's payment option (UF-05 step 9), and is confirmed.
4. When a session is full, it shows as full and cannot be booked.

---

## UF-08 Booking that needs a room or equipment (F-11)

**Set-up (Owner or Manager):** Services → Resources → add a room or piece of equipment; on the service, mark the resource as required.

**Customer:** books as in UF-05. Only slots where both the provider and the required resource are free are offered. The resource is reserved with the booking and freed when the booking is cancelled.

---

## UF-09 Ordering delivered work (F-12)

**Entry:** `/services` → a service priced per deliverable

1. Customer reads the service and selects Order.
2. Enters details and the brief (text and optional attachments).
3. Pays by the service's payment option (in full, deposit, or invoice with payment terms).
4. Receives an order confirmation email. The order's status is **ordered**.

The client then manages the order (UF-12).

---

## UF-10 Buying and using a session package (F-13)

**Buying:**
1. Customer selects a package on the service page (for example, 10 sessions) and pays.
2. The package and its balance appear in the customer portal (My Packages) and on the customer's contact record.

**Using:**
3. When booking the package's service (UF-05), the customer chooses **use a package session** at step 9; one session is drawn from the balance.
4. Cancelling within the allowed window returns the session to the balance.
5. When the package expires, unused sessions lapse and the customer is told before expiry.

---

## UF-11 Admin daily operations (F-04, F-11)

**Navigation:** the admin menu in `mb-3-cs-architecture-reference.md` section 9.

**Morning routine:** Dashboard — today's metrics, alerts and activity feed → process pending items → check today's calendar. (The spoken morning briefing, UF-31, gives the same picture by voice.)

**Using the calendar:** Sales & Operations → Bookings → Calendar. Month, week or day view; Today, previous and next to move through time; filter by provider (Owner, Manager, Admin) or by room or equipment. Staff see only their own bookings. Clicking a booking opens it; clicking an empty slot starts a new booking with the provider, date and time filled in. The calendar refreshes itself every minute. Build detail: `spec-calendar-feature.md`.

**Processing a booking:** open the booking → check details and payment status → confirm, reschedule or cancel. Confirming or rescheduling sends the customer an updated confirmation with a calendar invite. Cancelling frees the slot and any resource and returns a package session where the window allows. Bookings are cancelled, never deleted.

**Completing an appointment:** mark the booking completed → the invoice is generated (or the deposit balance invoiced) → the review request is sent (UF-27).

**No-show:** mark the booking no-show → the booking closes and the no-show is recorded on the customer's contact; any pay-on-the-day amount is not invoiced unless the client invoices a no-show fee manually.

---

## UF-12 Managing an order (F-12)

**Entry:** Sales & Operations → Orders

1. Open the order (status **ordered**) and review the brief.
2. Set it to **in progress** → the customer is emailed.
3. Deliver: attach the files and a message, set it to **delivered** → the customer is emailed with the delivery.
4. Any balance due is invoiced (UF-14).

---

## UF-13 Time tracking and invoicing hours (F-14)

**Entry:** Finance & Reports → Time Entries

**Logging time (Staff):**
1. Start the timer on a customer and service, or add an entry by hand (start, end, service, customer, description).
2. Mark the entry billable or not; the hourly rate comes from the service and can be changed on the entry.
3. Stop the timer; duration and total are calculated.

**Invoicing hours (Owner or Manager):**
4. Filter billable, uninvoiced entries by customer.
5. Select entries → Create Invoice → the entries become invoice lines and are marked invoiced in the same step, so they cannot be invoiced twice.

**Reports:** hours and value per provider, per customer and per service.

---

## UF-14 Invoices, payment terms and refunds (F-15)

**Entry:** Finance & Reports → Invoices

**Creating an invoice manually:**
1. New Invoice → select the customer → add lines (description, quantity, unit price), or pull in time entries, an order balance or a package.
2. Set the payment terms (for example, due on receipt, 7 days, 30 days); the due date is calculated from the issue date. The default terms are set in Settings → Invoicing.
3. Tax is added automatically at the client's tax rate from Settings → Invoicing, with the client's tax label and registration number; with a rate of 0 there is no tax line.
4. Save as draft, or send → PDF generated and emailed to the customer with a payment link.

**Lifecycle:** draft → sent → paid. An unpaid invoice past its due date becomes **overdue** (set by a nightly task) and the customer receives a reminder. Cancelling an invoice voids it.

**Recording payment:** online payments arrive through webhooks (UF-15); payments received another way (cash, bank transfer) are recorded manually → the invoice is marked paid and a receipt is emailed.

**Refunds:** open a paid invoice → Refund (full or part) → the refund is processed through the original gateway, or recorded as a manual refund → the customer is emailed, and the refund appears in the accounts reports (F-28).

---

## UF-15 Payment webhooks (F-15, F-29)

1. Stripe or PayPal sends a webhook to the client instance.
2. The handler verifies the webhook, returns HTTP 200 immediately, and defers the work to a background task ([[[default:adr-global/adr-webhook-architecture|Webhook Architecture]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-webhook-architecture.md) ADR).
3. The background task applies the result (booking confirmed, invoice paid, refund recorded) and writes the webhook payload to the client's R2 bucket. The data tables keep only the resulting state.

See [[[default:adr-global/adr-real-time-and-background-tasks|Real-Time Updates and Background Task Architecture]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-real-time-and-background-tasks.md) ADR for polling intervals and [[[default:adr-global/adr-pdf-invoice-generation|PDF Invoice Generation]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-pdf-invoice-generation.md) ADR for invoice generation.

---

## UF-16 Content management (F-06, F-21)

**Editing a page on the page itself (Owner or Manager):** open any public page while signed in → Edit → each text, image and video becomes editable where it sits → select a text and open the AI helper to write or rewrite it → replace an image by uploading a new one → Save publishes at once; Cancel discards. The same edit mode works on landing pages and published blog posts.

**Managing pages:** Content & Website → Pages → page name, SEO title, address and published state.

**Publishing a blog post:** Content & Website → Blog → New Post → write in the rich text editor → choose the post layout (classic centred, two-column with sidebar, full-width immersive) → set excerpt, category, tags, featured image, video and author → SEO settings (title, description, slug, keywords) → Publish Now, Save Draft, or Schedule (date and time). On publishing, the social captions are written and the Share button appears (UF-42).

**Comments:** Blog → Comments → approve, mark as spam or delete. Comments can be switched off in Settings.

---

## UF-17 Homepage customisation (F-07, F-09)

**Entry:** Content & Website → Pages → Homepage

1. Select a homepage layout — Classic, Services, Booking, Minimalist, or a further layout.
2. Configure the hero — headline, subheadline, hero image, call to action.
3. Configure features — up to 5 items (icon, title, description up to 100 characters).
4. Configure the services showcase — on or off, number shown (1–6), display style.
5. Configure testimonials — approved reviews (UF-27) are offered automatically; the Owner can also type in testimonials (name, text, rating, photo), up to 10 in total, and choose which appear.
6. Configure the video section — a video address (YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion or direct); the section hides if empty.
7. Configure the final call to action — headline, subheadline, button text and link.
8. Preview → Save → live immediately.

Changes auto-save every 30 seconds. The configuration is stored in the `config` table with `key = 'home_config'`.

---

## UF-18 Landing page creation (F-08)

**Entry:** Content & Website → Landing Pages

1. Choose a template — Lead Capture, Event Registration or Video Sales Letter.
2. Basic settings — title, address slug (generated, unique), status (draft or published).
3. Configure the template's content, or open the page and edit it in edit mode (UF-16).
4. Preview on the blank layout (no header or footer).
5. Publish → validated, saved to `landing_pages`, shareable address shown.
6. Share — copy the address, send a test email, share to social media, embed, add to an email campaign.

**Analytics:** views, conversions, conversion rate, referrer, device.

---

## UF-19 Contact form submission (F-06, F-17, F-20)

**Entry:** `/contact`

**Fields:** name (required), email (required), phone (optional), message (required, up to 1,000 characters).

**On submission:**
1. Saves the submission to `contact_submissions`.
2. Creates the contact, or updates the existing contact with the same email, and adds the enquiry to the contact's timeline.
3. Creates a follow-up task for the business.
4. Notifies the Owner, and sends the visitor an auto-reply if configured.
5. The form resets and shows a thank-you message.

This is how a customer contacts the business with a question or a problem; there is no customer ticket system.

---

## UF-20 Lead capture via landing page (F-19)

**Entry:** `/landing/:slug` — blank layout

1. Visitor arrives from a campaign → page view recorded with the source.
2. Views the content — headline, benefits, image or video, capture form.
3. Submits the form.
4. System: validates the email; creates the `leads` and `contacts` records together and sets `leads.converted_to_contact_id` at once; increments the conversion count; enrols the contact in the welcome sequence.
5. A thank-you message is shown.
6. The lead receives the welcome email with content, a call to action and an unsubscribe link.

**Owner:** receives a "new lead captured" notification. The lead appears in the CRM with lead status `new`.

**Funnel:** a blog post's call to action links to the landing page, and the landing page's call to action links into the booking flow (UF-05), with the source carried through each step.

---

## UF-21 Contact management (F-17)

**Entry:** Customers & Marketing → Contacts

**Overview:** total contacts, status breakdown (Lead, Customer, Inactive), pre-built segments, search, contact grid.

**Actions:** open a segment; search; open a contact (statistics, company, activity timeline including every email, deals, quotes, active campaigns, packages, open invoices, quick actions); add a contact; bulk actions (add tag, enrol in a campaign, CSV export); CSV import with column mapping, as in onboarding step 9.

**Companies:** Customers & Marketing → Companies → a company's details and its contacts, deals, quotes and invoices.

**Automatic creation:** contacts are created or updated automatically from bookings, orders, enquiry forms, landing page captures and Add as lead in the Team Inbox.

---

4. Review the email sequence — preview each email and its delay.
5. Set the trigger — event type, segment and delay before the first email.
6. Activate — confirm settings → Activate Campaign.
7. The campaign runs automatically — contacts are enrolled, emails are sent on schedule from the campaign's sender address, and opens, clicks, bounces and unsubscribes are reported by Amazon SES (payloads written to R2).

**Background process:** an hourly background task processes active enrolments.

---

## UF-24 Email broadcast (F-18)

**Entry:** Customers & Marketing → Broadcasts

## UF-28 Clause Builder (F-22)

**Entry:** Settings → Legal Pages

1. Choose the document — Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions or Cookie Policy.
2. The pre-written clauses load, grouped by category.
3. Edit clauses, add custom clauses, reorder by dragging, switch clauses on or off.
4. Save and publish → the public page updates immediately, the document's version rises by one, and a copy of that version is kept in the client's R2 bucket.

The client is responsible for the final wording being right for the client's business and jurisdiction.

---

## UF-29 Customer portal (F-24)

**Entry:** customer sign-in on the client's website

1. Customer signs in with password and second factor (or sets a password from the link in the first booking confirmation and enrols a second factor).
2. My Dashboard — upcoming bookings, package balances, open quotes, invoices due.
3. My Bookings — view, reschedule or cancel within the allowed window; book again.
4. My Packages — balance and expiry.
5. My Quotes — view, download PDF, accept or decline (UF-41).
6. My Invoices — view, download PDF, pay online.
7. My Reviews — reviews written and pending review requests.
8. Account — profile, password, email preferences.

Every view shows only the signed-in customer's own records.

---

## UF-30 Using the AI helper (F-26)

1. On a form where AI helps (for example, Business Profile, a service, a blog post, an invoice), the user presses the AI button.
2. The floating AI window opens over the page with the assist that fits the page already selected; the user can switch assists.
3. The user fills in the assist's fields — typing, or speaking (UF-31).
4. Generate → the result appears in the window.
5. Copy, edit, then Insert, Replace or Append into the form, or Cancel.
6. If the AI is unavailable, the window says so and the form keeps working normally.

Assists 9 (client sentiment summary) and 10 (booking and availability insights) give results on the sample data from the first day, and on the client's own data once the sample data is cleared (UF-43); on thin real data they say what they need.

---

## UF-31 WhatsUp voice (F-27)

**Entry:** the WhatsUp shortcut on the phone's home screen (added once from the app's "Add WhatsUp to home screen" option).

**Asking or creating:**
1. Tap the microphone and speak.
2. The speech is transcribed and understood.
3. Mybizz CS acts:
   - **Voice to an assist** — the spoken request fills the assist and the result is shown (UF-30).
   - **Task** — "Create a task — call Priya on Thursday" → the task is created and confirmed aloud.
   - **Question** — "What is my schedule for tomorrow?" → the answer is shown and spoken.
   - **Navigation** — "Show me unpaid invoices" → the screen opens.
   - **Form filling** — "New booking — Sarah Johnson, Swedish massage, Friday 2pm" → the booking form opens filled in, with any missing field highlighted; nothing is saved until the user confirms. Works for bookings, contacts, invoices, tasks, quotes and deals.
   - **Business question** — "Which days of the week are my busiest?" → the answer is worked out from the client's own figures, shown and spoken.
4. **Follow-up** — the user asks a further question in the same session; the answer takes the last answer into account. The session ends on close, after a pause, or on navigating away.
5. If the data cannot be retrieved, Mybizz CS says so clearly.

**Morning briefing:**
- With the briefing switched on, opening WhatsUp (or the app) in the morning plays a 20–30 second spoken summary: today's bookings, outstanding invoices, overdue tasks, new leads, flagged items.
- The briefing is switched on or off per user in Account settings.

---

## UF-32 Expenses, accounts reports and export (F-28)

**Recording an expense — Entry:** Finance & Reports → Expenses
1. New Expense → date, supplier, category, amount, tax included, payment method, notes.
2. Take or upload a photo of the receipt; the image is stored in the client's R2 bucket.
3. Save. An expense entered in error is marked void; it is never deleted.

**Export — Entry:** Finance & Reports → Accounts → Export
1. Choose the period (From and To; last month by default).

---

## UF-33 Restoring or viewing data from R2 (F-29)

**Viewing history (Owner) — Entry:** Settings → Data
1. Choose what to view — audit history older than 30 days, webhook records, past backups.

## UF-35 Team Inbox: reading, replying and managing email (F-18)

**Entry:** Inbox. Each staff member sees their own address and the desks the staff member belongs to; Owners see every address. Build detail: `spec-team-inbox.md`.

**Reading:**
1. Choose an address on the left and a folder: Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Archive, Spam or Trash.
2. Sort by date, sender, recipient or subject; filter by unread, starred, attachments, date range or sender; search across sender, recipient, subject, body and attachment names, in one address or in all of the user's addresses.
3. Open an email to see the whole conversation. An email from a contact links to the contact's record; an email from an unknown sender offers **Add as lead**.

**Replying and writing:**
4. Reply, Reply All or Forward, or New Email: choose the sending address, add recipients (contacts are suggested while typing), subject, text and attachments; the address's signature is added.
5. Ask the AI helper for a draft reply, in the app language, and edit it.
6. Send. The email leaves from the client's own domain and is saved in Sent. A draft is saved automatically while it is written.

**Organising:**
7. Select one or many emails → mark as read or unread, star, archive, move to another address, move to Spam, or delete. Trash keeps deleted emails for 30 days, with Restore.

**Unassigned:** an email to an address on the domain that does not exist lands in Unassigned, which Owners and Managers move to an address or delete.

---

## UF-36 Mybizz acts on an at-risk alert (F-34)

**Entry:** App 5 → Alerts

1. App 5 raises an alert when a client has no staff sign-in for 14 days, no bookings for 30 days, or a support ticket unanswered for 3 days.
2. Mybizz opens the alert and sees the client's usage history.
3. Mybizz contacts the Owner (email or call) and records the action and outcome on the client record.
4. The alert closes when the condition clears.

---

## UF-37 Release reaches every client (F-34)

1. A change is built and tested in App 1 and tagged as a release.
2. The developer pushes the release into App 2 (`master_template`) (Step 42).
3. Every client instance runs the new release immediately through its dependency.
4. If the release changes the schema, Mybizz applies the schema change to each client instance and records it in `schema-migration-log.md`.

---

## UF-38 Error recovery (F-11, F-15, F-01)

**Payment failure:**
1. Show the error.
2. Allow a retry with the same card.
3. If it still fails, offer another payment method.
4. Hold the booking for 15 minutes as **payment pending** and email the customer a payment link.
5. Release the slot, and any resource, if the hold expires unpaid.

**Session timeout:** after 30 minutes without activity the user is asked to sign in again; the user returns to where they were.

**AI or voice unavailable:** a clear message is shown or spoken; the form keeps working (UF-30, UF-31).

**Integration unavailable (Amazon SES, R2, a payment gateway):** the action is queued and retried in the background; the Owner is notified if it keeps failing.

**Email not delivered:** a bounce or complaint reported by Amazon SES adds the address to the suppression list; the sender sees the failed email marked in Sent with the reason.

---

## UF-39 Email addresses and desks (F-18)

**Entry:** Settings → Email (Owner, Manager)

1. Add an address: the part before the `@`, personal or desk, display name, members, signature.
2. A personal address is created for each staff member on invitation (UF-03); its member is that staff member.
3. A desk address (for example `help@`, `accounts@`) has several members, who share its read and unread state.
4. Set an auto-reply with a start and end date, or deactivate an address.
5. The Domain tab shows whether every DNS record is live.

**Deals — Entry:** Sales & Operations → Deals

6. A quote past its validity date becomes **expired** the next morning.

---

## UF-41 Customer accepts a quote (F-35, F-24)

1. The customer opens the link in the quote email (`/quote/{token}`) or My Quotes in the customer portal.
2. Reads the quote and selects **Accept** or **Decline**.
3. On acceptance, the invoice is created from the quote in the same step and emailed with a payment link; a linked deal moves to **won**; the business is notified.
4. On decline, the business is notified and a linked deal stays open for follow-up.

---

## UF-42 Sharing a blog post (F-21)

---

## UF-43 Clearing the sample data (F-04, F-26)

**Entry:** the sample data banner, or Settings → Data (Owner)

1. Clear sample data → a dialog states that every sample record is removed, that the client's own records stay, and that the step cannot be undone.
2. Confirm → a background task removes every sample record and recomputes the dashboard figures from the client's own data.
3. The banner disappears; the activity log records who cleared the sample data and when.

---

## UF-44 Trying the demo apps (F-36)

1. A prospect opens `demo.mybizz.live` (a business full of sample data) or `try.mybizz.live` (an empty Mybizz CS) from the Mybizz website and signs in with the prospect's own email address.
2. The prospect uses every feature. Every email the app sends goes to the prospect's own address; payments run in test mode with the test card shown on screen.
3. Every night both apps are reset and every demo sign-in is removed.
4. The prospect registers from the demo's Register button (UF-01).

3. Switch on the website badge, the pop-up, or both; each appears on the public website at once and goes when switched off.
4. A business that registers through the link appears as pending on the mock-up invoice, and as confirmed once its first annual payment completes.

## Flow Design Principles

- **Progressive disclosure** — show only what each step needs
- **Clear calls to action with progress indication**
- **Real-time input validation**
- **A recovery path for every error** — no dead ends
- **Automatic progress saving**
- **Email confirmation for every transaction**
- **Fewest possible server calls** — pre-load, batch, submit once at the end of a multi-step flow
- **Accepted terms at every agreement** — a booking, an order, a package purchase, an online payment, customer portal sign-up and quote acceptance each require the unticked box "I accept the Terms and Conditions and have read the Privacy Policy"; every form that takes personal details links to the Privacy Policy
- **Cookie choice first** — a visitor's first visit shows the cookie banner; no embedded map or video loads before Accept all or Load
