# Mybizz CS — Platform Architecture

**Vertical:** Consulting & Services
**Architecture:** Single vertical, dependency-based (master_template → client instances)
**UI Theme:** Material Design 3 (M3)
**Platform Capacity:** 100 clients (V1.x)
**Schema:** 44 tables (see [[authoritative-schema|Authoritative Database Schema]])

**Note:** The five-app dependency model (development workspace / master_template /
blank_client_template / client instances / platform-operator tooling) is Mybizz-wide — see
[[spec-five-app-architecture-model|Five-App Architecture Model (Specification)]]. This document contains only this app's specific
instantiation of that model and its own feature set.

## 1. What Mybizz CS Is

Mybizz CS is the Consulting & Services instantiation of the Mybizz platform — a complete online
business management platform delivered as a subscription SaaS product. Each subscriber receives
a fully operational, isolated Anvil application instance — their own online presence and business
management system, from public website through to CRM, bookings, payments, and reporting.

**Target businesses:** salons, spas, therapists, personal trainers, physiotherapists,
consultants, coaches, clinics, studios, and any business that sells services — either as timed
appointments or as fixed-price deliverables.

---

## 2. The Strategic Decision — Single Vertical

Mybizz was originally designed as a multi-vertical open platform supporting four business types:
Consulting & Services, E-commerce, Hospitality, and Membership. The decision was made to narrow
this app to a single vertical — Consulting & Services only.

The entire codebase, database schema, and planning documents for `mb-3-cs` are scoped to
Consulting & Services. Products, orders, shopping carts, shipping, room reservations, membership
tiers, subscription billing, and hospitality-specific features are explicitly out of scope for
this app.

## 3. This App's Five-App Instances

Per the Mybizz-wide model ([[spec-five-app-architecture-model|Five-App Architecture Model (Specification)]]), this app's actual
instance names:

| App | Instance Name |
|---|---|
| App 1 — Development workspace | `mb-3-cs` |
| App 2 — Published dependency | `master_template` |
| App 3 — Provisioning clone source | `blank_client_template` |
| App 4 — Client instances | `[client-name]-cs` |
| App 5 — Platform operator tooling | `Mybizz_management` (deferred, post-launch) |

**Note:** `mb-2-cs` was the original development application and has been deprecated. All
development has migrated to `mb-3-cs`.

## 7. Platform Constraints Summary

The platform is designed to work within Anvil's specific parameters. Key constraints:

- **Skulpt client-side runtime:** Not all Python 3 stdlib works. Money and date logic lives in
  server modules only. See [[adr-anvil-platform-constraints|Anvil Platform Constraints and Design Boundaries]] ADR.
- **No native URL routing:** Public pages use the community routing library. Admin portal uses
  lambda/Link/`open_form`. See [[adr-navigation-lambda-link-open-form|Navigation Standard: Lambda/Link/open_form]] ADR, [[adr-ui-customization-approach|UI Customization Approach]] ADR.
- **Lazy-loaded Data Table rows:** Never iterate without `.search()` or `.limit_to()`. See
  [[adr-data-access-patterns|Data Access Patterns and Query Limitations]] ADR.
- **Server call latency:** Every `anvil.server.call()` is an HTTP round-trip. Minimize in
  user-facing flows. See [[adr-form-architecture-and-state|Form Architecture and State Management]] ADR.
- **No WebSocket push:** Real-time updates use client-side timer polling. See [[adr-real-time-and-background-tasks|Real-Time Updates and Background Task Architecture]] ADR.
