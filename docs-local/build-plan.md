## Overview

This build plan defines the phased implementation sequence for the Mybizz CS V1 MVP. Each phase has clear deliverables, completion criteria, and inter-process dependencies.

**Key Principles:**
- Build sequentially — each phase depends on the prior phase being complete
- No phase is complete until all its stages pass completion criteria
- Security is woven through from Phase 0 — not bolted on later
- The Vault and authentication are foundational — nothing else builds without them
- All review tasks (CEO + Eng) are embedded as completion criteria

---

## Phase Structure

| Phase | Focus | Key Deliverables | Dependencies |
|-------|-------|------------------|--------------|
| 0 | Pre-Implementation | Test coverage, observability, deployment procedures, Vault error handling | None (starting point) |
| 1 | Foundation | Auth, RBAC, Vault, navigation, settings | Phase 0 complete |
| 2 | Transactional Core | Services, bookings, payments, invoicing | Phase 1 complete |
| 3 | CRM + Email | Contacts, campaigns, segments, tasks, landing pages | Phase 2 complete |
| 4 | Content + Website | Blog, public website, homepage templates | Phase 3 complete |
| 5 | Polish + Launch | Analytics, security, compliance, testing | Phase 4 complete |

- Full RBAC coverage required on all server functions, not just critical endpoints

### Stage 1.3: Dashboard & Navigation

**Deliverables:**
- `AdminLayout` — NavigationRailLayout with navigation
- `DashboardForm` — main admin dashboard with metrics
- Navigation structure implemented (Dashboard, Sales & Operations, Customers & Marketing, Content & Website, Finance & Reports, Settings)

  - Payment Gateway, Services, Users & Permissions, Email Configuration, Theme, Feature Flags
  - "Return to Onboarding" button in header (visible when onboarding in progress)
- `tests/test_settings.py` — settings unit tests

**Completion Criteria:**
- ✅ Business profile can be saved and retrieved
- ✅ Feature flags functional (bookings_enabled, services_enabled, etc.)
- ✅ Theme customization persists and applies correctly

**Implementation Notes:**
- SettingsForm uses sub-sections for better maintainability
- Currency becomes immutable after first transaction
- Feature flags control navigation item visibility
- **See:** `ui-customization-approach` ADR (UI Customization Approach)

- Per-client management token stored in client instance config

**Endpoints (per `mybizz-management-visibility` ADR):**

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/management/health` | GET | Returns health metrics, last active, error summary |
| `/management/status` | GET | Returns subscription status, feature flags |
| `/management/suspend` | POST | Writes suspended flag to client tables |
| `/management/unsuspend` | POST | Clears suspended flag |
| `/management/push-notification` | POST | Writes notification row to client notifications table |
| `/management/push-update-alert` | POST | Writes update available notice to client tables |

**Authentication:** Each request must include a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header. The token is validated against a value stored in the client instance's management configuration. Requests without a valid token are rejected with HTTP 403.

**Completion Criteria:**
- ✅ All management endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ Bearer token authentication enforced on all endpoints
- ✅ Invalid tokens receive HTTP 403
- ✅ Health endpoint returns current metrics from `health_log` and `error_log` tables
- ✅ Module ships with master_template — all client instances have endpoints from provisioning

**Note:** Mybizz_management (App 5) is deferred. These endpoints exist so that client instances are management-ready from day one. Until Mybizz_management is built, the endpoints are unused but functional.

## Inter-Process Dependencies

### Critical Path
```
Phase 0 (Pre-Implementation) → Phase 1 (Foundation) → Phase 2 (Transactional Core) → Phase 3 (CRM + Email) → Phase 4 (Content + Website) → Phase 5 (Polish + Launch)
```

### Cross-Phase Dependencies
- **Phase 1 depends on Phase 0:** Test coverage, observability, deployment procedures must be defined first
- **Phase 2 depends on Phase 1:** Services need users (providers), bookings need contacts (from Phase 3, but contacts table exists in Phase 1), payments need Vault (Phase 1)
- **Phase 3 depends on Phase 2:** Contacts auto-created from bookings, campaigns triggered by booking events
- **Phase 4 depends on Phase 3:** Blog and landing pages feed contacts, public website uses contact forms
- **Phase 5 depends on Phase 4:** Analytics uses data from all phases, security hardening covers all features

### Data Flow Dependencies
- `users` table (Phase 1) → all other tables
- `contacts` table (Phase 3) → bookings, tasks, campaigns
- `services` table (Phase 2) → bookings
- `bookings` table (Phase 2) → invoices, contact_events
- `email_campaigns` table (Phase 3) → contact_campaigns
- `landing_pages` table (Phase 3) → leads → contacts

**See:** `anvil-platform-constraints` ADR (Anvil Platform Constraints) for platform-specific implementation guidance.

## Self-Review Checklists

**Source:** CEO review 2026-06-15 Section 5

For a solo developer, self-review is where bugs hide. Complete the following checklist before marking any stage as done.

### Phase 1 Self-Review (Foundation)

- [ ] All server functions have RBAC decorators — grep for `@authenticated_endpoint` or equivalent
- [ ] No secrets in client code — search for hardcoded API keys, passwords, or tokens
- [ ] Settings form tabs respect RBAC visibility — test with each role
- [ ] Vault TOTP gate works on every open — no grace period
- [ ] Currency selection is immutable after first transaction — test the guardrail
- [ ] Navigation links resolve correctly — no dead links or 404s
- [ ] Mobile responsive layout verified at 375px minimum width

### Phase 2 Self-Review (Transactional Core)

- [ ] Payment webhook signature verification rejects invalid signatures
- [ ] Idempotency check prevents duplicate payment processing
- [ ] Booking status transitions are correct (PENDING → CONFIRMED → COMPLETED/CANCELLED)
- [ ] Double-booking prevention works — test concurrent booking attempts
- [ ] Invoice amounts match booking amounts (including tax/currency)
- [ ] External service failures handled gracefully (Brevo, Stripe, Paystack)
- [ ] All financial calculations use server-side functions (not Skulpt)

### Phase 3 Self-Review (CRM + Email)

- [ ] Contact deduplication works — same email updates existing contact
- [ ] Campaign enrollment does not duplicate contacts
- [ ] Unsubscribe handling works — contact removed from future sends
- [ ] Empty states display correctly for all list views
- [ ] Pagination works correctly with 50-item pages
- [ ] Landing page lead capture creates both `leads` and `contacts` simultaneously
- [ ] Database indexes verified on high-query columns

### Phase 4 Self-Review (Content + Website)

- [ ] Public pages render correctly on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] SEO meta tags present on all public pages
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- [ ] Screen reader support verified for key flows
- [ ] Contact form creates `contact_submissions` record
- [ ] ClauseBuilder saves correctly to both `privacy_policy` and `t_and_c` tables
- [ ] Form debounce prevents double-submissions

### Phase 5 Self-Review (Polish + Launch)

- [ ] All critical flows tested end-to-end (booking, payment, email)
- [ ] RBAC coverage matrix verified for all roles and forms
- [ ] Error path tests pass (payment failure, webhook timeout, service down)
- [ ] Backup/restore procedure tested and documented
- [ ] Deployment rollback procedure tested
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured and tested
- [ ] No critical or high-severity issues in error_log
