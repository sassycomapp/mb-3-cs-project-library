## Notes

- **README.md** does not exist in this directory. The project README lives at the repository root.
- All cross-references to global documents (ADRs, specifications) use descriptive slugs (e.g., [[[default:adr-global/adr-anvil-platform-constraints|Anvil Platform Constraints and Design Boundaries]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-anvil-platform-constraints.md) ADR, [[[default:specifications-global/spec-deployment|Deployment Specification]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-deployment.md)). Legacy numeric-prefix references (e.g., `4-lead-capture-simultaneous-creation.md`) are stale — see the integration report for full findings.
- The `docs-standard-global/` directory contains placeholder documents not yet verified for integration — their correction is a separate workstream.
