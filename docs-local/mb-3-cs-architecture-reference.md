# Mybizz CS — Architecture Reference

## 0. Authority

This document is the build standard for the architecture of Mybizz CS. Agents build from this document. Where `mb-3-cs-concept.md` or `mb-3-cs-architecture-explainer.md` differs from this document on a technical fact, this document is correct.

Every feature carries the number and name it has in `mb-3-cs-concept.md` section 7 (F-01 to F-36); the client-facing list of every feature is `mb-3-cs-feature-list.md`. Detail that has its own home is linked, not repeated:

| Subject | Home |
|---|---|
| Data tables and fields | `docs-standard-local/authoritative-schema.md` |
| User flows | `docs-local/user-flows.md` |
| Design system | `docs-local/DESIGN.md`; palette colour values in `m3-custom-theme` |

## 1. The Five-App System

The five-app model is Mybizz-wide ([[[default:specifications-global/spec-five-app-architecture-model|Five-App Architecture Model (Specification)]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-five-app-architecture-model.md)). This section is the Mybizz CS instance of that model.

| App | Role | Repository | Hosted on | Web address |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| App 1 | Development workspace | `mb-3-cs-app1` | Mybizz's Anvil Business account | `mb-3-cs-app1.mybizz.live` |
| App 2 | `master_template` — the published dependency | `mb-3-cs-app2` | Mybizz's Anvil Business account | none |
| App 3 | `blank_client_template` — the client app | `mb-3-cs-app3` | Mybizz's Anvil Business account | none |
| App 4 | Client instances, one per client | release image defined in `mb-3-cs-app4` | DigitalOcean: one container and one database per client | the client's own domain |
| App 5 | Mybizz management app | `mb-3-cs-app5` | Mybizz's Anvil Business account | `mb-3-cs-app5.mybizz.live` |

### App 1 — development workspace
- All feature development happens here. Holds every data table (development and test data), every form, every server module and all application code.
- Connected to GitHub as the shared source of truth between Anvil and the local copy agents work in.
- Each release is tagged here. Never a dependency for any client instance.

### App 2 — `master_template`
- The sole source of all server-side logic and all forms for every client instance.
- Receives App 1's tagged release, pushed into its repository by the developer (Step 42).
- Stateless: holds no client data.
- Built into the release image with App 3. A client instance calling `anvil.server.call()` runs `master_template`'s server modules; a client instance showing a form shows `master_template`'s form.

### App 3 — `blank_client_template`
- The client app every client instance runs.
- Holds the full table definitions (no data), one startup module, the scheduled tasks and `master_template` as a dependency. Zero server modules, zero forms.
- Updated at every release that changes the table definitions. `encryption_key` is set per instance at provisioning.
- Each client's App Server builds the client's tables from App 3's table definitions, and adds each release's new tables and columns.

### App 4 — client instances
- Each client instance runs on the Anvil App Server, as one container on DigitalOcean App Platform named `[client-name]-cs`, with its own database in Mybizz CS's DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL cluster ([[[default:specifications-global/spec-client-instance-hosting|Client Instance Hosting]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-client-instance-hosting.md)).
- Runs the release image: App 3 and `master_template` on the App Server version Mybizz pins. Nothing else.
- Updated through the release image: App 5's Release action moves every client instance to each new release; new tables and columns arrive with it.
- The test client instance is a client instance of its own, holding test data only.
- Clients never have access to the container, the database or any source code. Clients use their app only.

### App 5 — Mybizz management app
- Built and running before the first paying client (F-34).
- Does not depend on client instances. Communicates with client instances through HTTP endpoints secured with a per-client Bearer token ([[[default:specifications-global/spec-api-specification|API Specification (HTTP Endpoints)]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-api-specification.md), [[[default:adr-global/adr-mybizz-management-visibility|Mybizz_management Visibility and Control]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-mybizz-management-visibility.md) ADR).
- Creates, releases to and removes client instances through the DigitalOcean API.
- Client instances expose the management endpoints from their first day.

---

## 2. Rule: No Forms or Server Modules in App 3

Every client instance runs App 3 on `master_template`. A form or server module added to App 3 silently overrides `master_template` for every client, and later fixes to that form or module stop reaching clients.

- App 3 holds only its startup module, table definitions and scheduled tasks.
- A change needed for one client is made in App 1, tested on the test client instance, and released into `master_template` (Step 42); every client instance then receives it.
- App 3's repository and `mb-3-cs-app4` carry a README stating this rule ([[[default:adr-global/adr-client-instance-readme-five-app-system|Mandatory README in Every Client Instance Documenting the Five-App System]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-client-instance-readme-five-app-system.md) ADR); the image build stops if App 3 holds a form or server module.

---

## 3. Data Isolation

- Each client instance is a separate App Server with a separate database. `app_tables` always resolves to the current client's data. Cross-client access is architecturally impossible.
- `master_template` holds no client data. All state lives in the client's own database and the client's own R2 bucket.
- Mybizz does not copy a client's customer data into App 5. App 5 holds client-level records only: registry, usage figures, health, billing, tickets and feedback.

---

## 4. Hosting and Capacity (F-33)

- **Platform:** each client instance runs in its own DigitalOcean App Platform container (1 GiB memory), with its own database in Mybizz CS's Managed PostgreSQL cluster, as [[[default:specifications-global/spec-client-instance-hosting|Client Instance Hosting]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-client-instance-hosting.md) sets out. Email goes through Amazon SES (F-18).
- **Usage reporting:** each client instance reports its memory use, storage, email volume, heavy-job activity, last staff sign-in and last booking date to App 5 through the management endpoints, on a schedule.
- **Heavy jobs:** imports, exports, backups, AI generation, briefings, campaign sending and inbound email processing run as background tasks.
- **Capacity:** a hard limit of 100 client instances for Mybizz CS. The cluster is sized to the client count (Client Instance Hosting section 4).

---

## 5. Provisioning and Registration (F-03, F-34)

1. The client registers. App 5 creates the client record and the client reference number. As part of registration, the client opens a free Cloudflare account in the client's own name, adds a payment method, switches R2 on, adds the client's domain to Cloudflare DNS, and invites Mybizz's Cloudflare user as a member with the roles Cloudflare R2 Admin and DNS.
2. App 5's New client action creates the client's database and database user, the instance's `encryption_key`, Bearer token and container keys, and the client's container `[client-name]-cs` from the current release image; the App Server builds the client's tables.
3. App 5 accepts the client's Cloudflare invitation, creates the client's R2 bucket and a token for that bucket only, creates the client's Amazon SES tenant, domain identity, receipt rule, SNS topics and scoped AWS keys (`spec-team-inbox.md`), and writes every key into the instance's Vault. The container's SMTP settings hold the SES SMTP endpoint and the client's SES credentials. The Bearer token and the client's Mybizz-side credentials are stored in App 5.
4. App 5 loads the sample data for the client's trade (section 16).
5. The client completes the onboarding wizard in the instance (F-03); its domain step has App 5 add the client's domain to the container and write the client's DNS records (website, MX, DKIM, MAIL FROM, SPF, DMARC) through the Cloudflare API.

Procedure detail: [[[default:specifications-global/spec-client-activation-runbook|Client Instance Activation Runbook]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-client-activation-runbook.md).

---

## 6. Development Workflow

- Agents work in the local copy of App 1; the developer pushes to GitHub; Anvil syncs from GitHub.
- Changes made in the Anvil Designer are pulled into the local copy with Step 18's pull procedure before any agent edits code.
- Designer work always precedes code work for any given form.
- This workflow applies to App 1 only (section 2).

---

## 7. Package Structure

Feature-based organisation. Existing packages are never renamed or merged during active development; new packages are added for new features.

```
client_code/
  analytics/      auth/           blog/           bookings/

  server_automation/ server_ai/         server_storage/    server_inbox/
  server_support/    server_management/ server_sales/      server_accounts/
```

- The client-side CRM and marketing package is `crm/`; the server-side package is `server_marketing/` ([[[mb-3-cs-project-library:adr-local/adr-crm-package-replaces-marketing|Package Name: crm/ Replaces marketing/]]](C:/dev/dev-mb-3-cs/mb-3-cs-project-library/adr-local/adr-crm-package-replaces-marketing.md) ADR).
- `server_payments/` holds invoices, payments, refunds and every gateway.
- `server_storage/` holds all Cloudflare R2 access (F-29).
- `server_inbox/` holds the Team Inbox: addresses, received email, conversations and the SES endpoints (F-18).
- `server_shared/email_service` sends every outgoing email through Amazon SES (F-18).
- `server_sales/` holds deals, companies and quotes (F-35).
- `server_accounts/` holds expenses, the accounts reports and the accounting export (F-28).
- `shared/translations/` holds the translation module, one phrase file per app language and the date, number and money formats; every screen text, email and document text is read from it (F-25).
- `server_management/` holds the management HTTP endpoints called by App 5.
- `server_support/` sends Help messages to App 5 (F-32).
- `components/` holds every shared custom component listed in `custom-component-requirements-matrix.md`.
- `ai/` holds the WhatsUp voice view and the client-side AI modules; the AI helper itself is a shared component in `components/`.

---

## 8. Module Architecture

The general three-tier module pattern (forms / client modules / server modules / pure logic modules) is defined in [[[default:specifications-global/spec-anvil-platform-standards|Anvil Platform Mechanics]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-anvil-platform-standards.md) section 3. This project's authority for the pattern: [[[default:adr-global/adr-form-architecture-and-state|Form Architecture and State Management]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-form-architecture-and-state.md) ADR.

---

## 9. Navigation

General navigation patterns: [[[default:specifications-global/spec-ui-standards|UI Standards]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-ui-standards.md) section 9.

| Area | System |
|---|---|
| Admin and customer portal | Native M3 layouts (`NavigationRailLayout` / `NavigationDrawerLayout`) + the layouts' `NavigationLink` components + lambda click handlers |
| Public website pages | Anvil Routing dependency (`@router.route`) |

`HTMLTemplate` is banned; all layout shells use the native M3 layouts. Sidebar navigation uses the layouts' `NavigationLink` components with lambda click handlers that capture their loop variables (`lambda e, fn=form_name: self._nav_click(fn)`); parameterised navigation uses `open_form()`. `navigate_to` is never used. See [[[default:adr-global/adr-htmltemplate-use|HTMLTemplate Use]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-htmltemplate-use.md) ADR, [[[default:adr-global/adr-navigation-lambda-link-open-form|Navigation Standard: Lambda/Link/open_form]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-navigation-lambda-link-open-form.md) ADR, [[[default:adr-global/adr-ui-customization-approach|UI Customization Approach]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-ui-customization-approach.md) ADR.

```

The AI helper (F-26) is a component placed on forms, not a navigation item. WhatsUp (F-27) opens from a home screen shortcut to the voice view.

---

## 10. Startup and Authentication Routing

The startup form is `auth.LoginForm` (defined in `anvil.yaml`). Its `__init__` checks authentication and routes before `init_components()`:

1. Signed in as Owner, Manager, Admin or Staff → open `DashboardForm` in AdminLayout, return.
2. Signed in as Customer → open the customer portal in CustomerLayout, return.
3. Not signed in → show the sign-in form.

`open_form()` in `__init__` is always followed by `return`. See [[[default:adr-global/adr-anvil-platform-constraints|Anvil Platform Constraints and Design Boundaries]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-anvil-platform-constraints.md) ADR.

---

## 11. The Sidesheet

The M3 Sidesheet is available on `NavigationDrawerLayout` and `NavigationRailLayout`, for secondary content or detail panels alongside the main content. `NavigationRailLayout` with a Sidesheet serves step-by-step guided workflows (onboarding, booking): accumulated data passes in `self.item` between steps and is submitted to the server in one call at the final step.

---

## 12. Feature Architecture

Each feature below states its packages, data, rules and links. Tables and fields are in `authoritative-schema.md`; flows are in `user-flows.md`.

### F-01 Accounts, roles and access
- Anvil Users service, email and password; email confirmation required; password reset by email.
- Every account holder signs in with a second factor (authenticator app or security key), customers with a portal account included; the Owner uses FIDO2 (a security key or the device's passkey). Guests book and pay without an account. A lost second factor is reset by the user through Anvil's reset by email ([[[default:specifications-global/spec-security|Security Specification]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-security.md)).
- Sign-in, sign-up and two-factor screens are the app's own (`auth/`), so they show the app language; Anvil's built-in forms are not used.
- New users (Owner, staff, customers) set their own password from an emailed link; no password is ever sent by email.
- Sessions end after 30 minutes without activity; the user signs in again and returns to the same place.
- Five roles: Owner, Manager, Admin, Staff, Customer, held in the user's `role` field.
- Every server function checks the role with the custom role decorators; the interface hides what a role cannot use, but the server is the enforcement.
- Rate-limited sign-in and account lockout ([[[default:specifications-global/spec-security|Security Specification]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-security.md)).
- Every significant action writes an audit record (F-29 for retention).
- Packages: `auth/`, `server_auth/`. Role limits: [[[default:specifications-global/spec-security-architecture|Security & Secrets Architecture]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-security-architecture.md).

### F-02 The Vault
- One Anvil Secret per instance: `encryption_key`, used only by `vault_service.py`.
- Every other credential (gateway keys, AWS keys for Amazon SES and S3, the SES SMTP password, R2 keys) is encrypted in the Vault's data table with that key.
- Owner-only; every view requires a sign-in with the Owner's second factor in the last five minutes and a code from the Owner's authenticator app (TOTP), with no remembered session; every access emails the owner; after 5 failed codes the Vault locks for 15 minutes and the owner is emailed.
- A lost Vault authenticator is reset by the Owner alone, after a fresh sign-in, through an emailed link: `sop-vault-recovery.md`.
- Detail: `vault-implementation.md`, [[[default:specifications-global/spec-vault-system|The Vault System]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-vault-system.md).

### F-03 Registration, onboarding and setup
- Registration happens in App 5 (section 5); App 5 issues the client reference number.
- Onboarding in the instance is a resumable wizard on `NavigationRailLayout` with a Sidesheet, a progress indicator and a help video on every step: app language → business profile → brand palette → system currency → legal acknowledgement (timestamped) → payment gateway → connect the client's domain (website and email DNS records, written by App 5 and checked until live) → import existing contacts.
- The contact import reads a CSV file, with ready-made column mappings for the exports of HubSpot, Mailchimp and Acuity and a manual mapping for any other file; it matches existing contacts by email.
- The AI helper's bio/profile writer offers the first website text from the business profile.
- Progress is saved after each step; onboarding and Settings link to each other.
- Packages: `onboarding/`, `server_settings/`. Engineering plan: [[[default:specifications-global/spec-onboarding-implementation-plan|Mybizz CS Onboarding System - Engineering Plan]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-onboarding-implementation-plan.md).

### F-04 Dashboard and analytics
- Metric cards (revenue, bookings, customers) with current value, percentage change and trend; trend charts; activity feed; period comparison (week, month, custom range).
- Dashboard figures are read from pre-computed summary tables, refreshed by background task, not computed on page load.
- Advanced analytics: revenue by service and by provider, marketing return on investment per campaign and landing page, PDF and CSV export, scheduled reports emailed by background task.
- The sample data banner and the Owner's Clear sample data button (section 16).
- Packages: `dashboard/`, `analytics/`, `server_dashboard/`, `server_analytics/`.

### F-05 Settings Hub
- One tabbed form; tabs: Business Profile (including the app language), Brand Palette, System Currency (read-only), Display Currency, Legal Acknowledgement (read-only), Payment Gateways (test/live), Invoicing (default payment terms, numbering, quote validity), Users and Permissions, Email (addresses, desks, members, signatures, auto-replies), Domain (DNS record status), Theme, Feature Switches (`marketing_enabled`, `blog_enabled`, comments), Legal Pages (Clause Builder, F-22), Data (history view, export, sample data, F-29). The Invoicing tab also holds the tax rate (default 0), tax label and tax registration number; the Theme tab holds the public website header style only.
- Tabs are shown per role: Owner sees all; Manager sees operational tabs, not financial or security tabs.
- Packages: `settings/`, `server_settings/`.

### F-06 Public website
- Public pages are served through Anvil Routing: Home, About, Contact, Services listing and detail, Blog listing and post, Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions, Cookie Policy, landing pages.
- The contact form creates a contact and a follow-up task (F-17, F-20).
- Google Maps embed on Contact and in the footer, optional.
- Meta tags, semantic structure and clean addresses on every public page; fully responsive. Every public route sets its title, description and Open Graph tags on the server through the Routing dependency's `Route.meta` (`spec-sm-syndication.md`).
- Front-end editing: for an Owner or Manager signed in, every public page shows an Edit button. Edit mode makes each text, image and video element of the page editable in place; the AI helper writes or rewrites the selected text; Save writes the page's content (`pages.components`, `config.home_config`, `landing_pages.config`, `blog_posts.content`) in one server call and publishes it; Cancel discards. Images are uploaded to `files`. Every save is recorded in `activity_log`.
- The instance runs on the client's own domain: an Anvil custom domain on the instance's environment, with a DNS `A` record written by App 5 in the client's Cloudflare DNS (section 5).
- Packages: `public_pages/`, `layouts/`, `components/` (the edit mode).

### F-07 Homepage templates
- Four layouts — Classic, Services, Booking, Minimalist — plus further layouts, all composed from the same section components; a layout is a section order and visibility set.
- Optional sections render only when configured: video (a video address is set), services carousel (active services exist).
- Packages: `public_pages/`, `components/`.

### F-08 Landing pages
- Templates: Lead Capture, Event Registration, Video Sales Letter, on a blank layout with no header or footer.
- A landing page is created in LandingPageEditorForm (template, slug, tracking); its content is edited on the page itself in edit mode (F-06).
- Each landing page counts views and conversions.
- Packages: `landing_pages/`, `server_marketing/`.

### F-09 Visual and media presentation
- Parallax hero; carousels are `m3.Carousel` in the hero layout, advanced every 6 seconds by a Timer on the host form, with a pause/play button; rotation stops when the visitor moves the carousel and never starts under reduced motion.
- One video component for homepage, service pages and blog posts; accepts YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion and direct video addresses; hides itself when no address is set.
- Packages: `components/`.

### F-10 Service catalogue
- Pricing model `duration` (price per time block; drives slot calculation) or `unit` (price per deliverable; no slot).
- Per service: name, description, category, pricing model, price, duration, delivery mode, providers, images, video, meeting types, intake form, display currency, active status.
- Delivery modes: at the business, at the customer's location, online live, delivered work, group.
- Packages: `services/`, `server_services/`.

### F-11 Bookings and scheduling
- Booking flow as in `user-flows.md`; one continuous flow with no external redirects.
- Calendar: month, week (seven days across, times down) and day views for Owner, Manager, Admin and Staff; Staff see only their own bookings, enforced on the server; one server call per period, returning only the visible period; colours from status tokens, never hardcoded; refreshed every 60 seconds while open. Build detail: `spec-calendar-feature.md`.
- Availability: business hours per weekday, provider schedules, blocked dates, date exceptions.
- Meeting types: at the business; at the customer's location (address captured; travel buffer before and after, set per service); video call (link generated and sent with confirmation and reminders); phone call.
- Group sessions: one session with a place limit; each place is a booking against the session.
- Resources: rooms and equipment are bookable resources; a service may require a resource, and a slot is available only when provider and resource are both free.
- Payment option per service: pay in full now, pay a deposit now, pay on the day, or invoice with payment terms; a customer with a package can use a package session (F-13, F-15).
- Bookings paid now, or booked on pay on the day or invoice terms, are confirmed at once; a booking whose online payment has not succeeded is held as payment pending for 15 minutes with an emailed payment link, then released.
- Every confirmation and reschedule email carries a calendar invite.
- Resources (rooms and equipment) are managed under Services → Resources.
- Reminders at 24 hours and 1 hour, sent by scheduled background task (F-18).
- Recurring bookings (weekly, every two weeks, monthly); reschedule without cancellation; special requests; statuses pending, confirmed, completed, no_show, cancelled. Marking a booking completed triggers its invoice (or balance invoice) and the review request. Bookings are cancelled, never deleted.
- Double-booking is prevented on the server at the moment of confirmation.
- Packages: `bookings/`, `server_bookings/`.

### F-12 Orders for delivered work
- An order is placed for a `unit`-priced service, paid at ordering, with status ordered → in progress → delivered.
- Delivery can attach files and a message; the customer is emailed at each status change.
- Packages: `orders/`, `server_orders/`.

### F-13 Session packages
- A package defines a service, a number of sessions, a price and an expiry period.
- A purchased package holds a balance; each booking against it draws one session; cancellations within the allowed window return the session.
- Packages: `packages/`, `server_packages/`.

### F-14 Time tracking
- Data: the `time_entries` table — contact, provider, service, optional booking, start, end, calculated duration, hourly rate, calculated total, description, billable flag, invoiced flag.
- Providers log entries manually or with a start/stop timer.
- Billable, uninvoiced entries for a contact are converted into invoice lines (F-15) and marked invoiced in the same server call.
- Reports: hours and value per provider, per customer, per service.
- Packages: `time_tracking/`, `server_time/`.

### F-15 Invoicing and payments
- Invoices are generated automatically on booking completion and on quote acceptance (F-35), and created manually or from time entries, orders and packages.
- Payment terms per invoice (due on receipt, 7 days, 30 days, or set days); the due date is calculated from the issue date; default terms are set in Settings → Invoicing.
- Tax: each client sets a tax rate (default 0), a tax label and a registration number in Settings → Invoicing; the rate at issue is stored on the invoice; no tax line appears when the rate is 0.
- Lifecycle: draft → sent → paid; overdue set by a nightly task, with a reminder email to the customer; cancelled. Sequential numbering per instance (`INV-{year}-{sequence}`).
- Payments received outside the gateways (cash, bank transfer) are recorded manually; refunds are full or partial, through the original gateway or recorded manually.
- PDF generation, email delivery, payment recording, refunds.
- Gateways: Stripe as the card gateway, plus PayPal as an option. One gateway-agnostic payment service (`server_payments/`) sits behind all three; switching gateways does not change services or bookings.
- PayPal: offered only when the system currency is one PayPal supports (not ISK). PayPal's buttons (`PayPalButtonComponent`) take the buyer's approval; the server creates and captures the order through PayPal's Orders API with amounts from the database. Detail: `integration-architecture.md` (PayPal).
- Every payment and refund, by any gateway or by hand, is a `payments` row; the gateway's fee is recorded on it (`gateway_fee`) and shown in the accounts as an expense (F-28).
- Gateway webhooks are received by HTTP endpoints, verified, applied, and their payloads written to R2 (F-29).
- Test and live modes per gateway. Money logic runs in server modules only.
- Packages: `invoices/`, `server_payments/`. Integration patterns: [[[default:specifications-global/spec-integration|Integration Specification]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-integration.md).

### F-16 Dual currency
- System currency set at onboarding; locked once the first booking or invoice exists.
- Display currency optional per service; display only. All stored amounts, totals and reports are in the system currency.

### F-17 CRM and contacts
- One `contacts` record per person with status Lead, Customer or Inactive, optionally linked to a company (F-35); activity timeline from bookings, emails (received and sent, F-18), quotes, deals, notes, forms.
- Contacts are created automatically by bookings, enquiries, landing page forms and Add as lead in the Team Inbox.
- Pre-built segments (New Leads, Active Customers, Inactive Customers, High Value) and a custom segment builder over tags, status, total spend and booking history.
- CSV import and export.
- Packages: `crm/`, `server_customers/`, `server_marketing/`.

### F-18 Email
- Build detail: `spec-team-inbox.md`.
- Every email received and sent goes through Amazon SES in Mybizz's AWS account (`eu-west-1`), one SES tenant per client. Anvil's own email quota is not used.
- Receiving: the client domain's MX record points to SES; SES scans each email, stores it in S3 and notifies the instance's endpoint `/_/api/email/inbound`; a background task stores it in `email_messages`, moves attachments to R2 and links it to a contact.
- Team Inbox (`inbox/TeamInboxForm`): unlimited personal and desk addresses (`email_addresses`); each staff member sees the addresses the staff member belongs to; Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Archive, Spam, Trash; reply, reply all, forward; sort, filter, search; star, mark as unread; bulk actions; conversations by `Message-ID`; Add as lead; AI assist 6 drafts replies.
- Sending: `server_shared/email_service` sends every email through the SES API from the client's domain, DKIM-signed: Team Inbox email, transactional email (confirmations, reminders, invoices, receipts) and marketing email. Anvil's Users service email goes through Anvil's Email service set to Custom Mail Server with the SES SMTP endpoint.
- Marketing email: sequences, broadcasts and newsletters, segment targeting, SES open and click tracking, one-click unsubscribe (`List-Unsubscribe` and `List-Unsubscribe-Post`), suppression of bounces and complaints (`email_suppressions`), sending in batches within the SES rate.
- SES events and inbound notifications are recorded in `webhook_log` (`gateway` = `ses`) with their payloads in R2 (F-29).
- Packages: `inbox/`, `crm/`, `server_inbox/`, `server_marketing/`, `server_shared/`.

### F-19 Lead capture and marketing funnel
- A lead capture submission creates the lead and the contact in one server call, linked, with source recorded.
- Capture analytics per form; automatic enrolment into a sequence.
- Funnel links: blog post call-to-action → landing page → booking flow, each step recording the source.
- Packages: `landing_pages/`, `server_marketing/`.

### F-20 Tasks and automation
- Tasks linked to contacts, with due date, notes and completion timestamp.
- Automatic tasks from events (enquiry without booking, review request after appointment).
- Automation rules: trigger event + conditions + actions (create task, send email, enrol in sequence); evaluated by background task.
- Voice-created tasks arrive through F-27.
- Packages: `crm/`, `server_automation/`.

### F-21 Blog and content
- Rich text editor; post layouts classic centred, two-column with sidebar, full-width immersive; pullquotes; featured image and video.
- SEO title, description, slug and keywords per post; statuses draft, scheduled, published, archived (scheduled posts publish at their set time by background task); categories; view counts.
- Public listing in tiled grid or list-with-thumbnails view.
- Comments with moderation (approve, spam, delete), switchable in Settings.
- New posts are written in BlogEditorForm; published posts are corrected in edit mode on the page itself (F-06).
- Social media sharing: the Share panel, AI captions per platform (`blog_posts.share_captions`), platform share links, `?ref=` tracking, the `/_/api/blog-image/{slug}` endpoint and reader share buttons, as `spec-sm-syndication.md` specifies.
- Packages: `blog/`, `server_blog/`.

### F-22 Clause Builder
- Clauses for the Privacy Policy, the Terms and Conditions and the Cookie Policy (`privacy_policy`, `t_and_c`, `cookie_policy`): seeded clauses, custom clauses, categories, order, active flag; a Cookie Policy clause with a `feature_key` is active exactly while its feature (`maps`, `video`, `payments`) is in use.
- Publishing regenerates the public policy page immediately, raises the document's version in `config.legal_versions`, and writes the published text to R2 at `legal/{document}/v{version}.html`.
- Acceptance: a booking, an order, a package purchase, an online payment, customer portal sign-up and quote acceptance each require the unticked box "I accept the Terms and Conditions and have read the Privacy Policy"; a new version is accepted at the next agreement or portal sign-in. The contact form and lead-capture forms link to the Privacy Policy beside the submit button.
- Cookie banner on every public page (Accept all, Refuse all, More info), the `mb_consent` cookie, and a Cookie settings link in the footer; embedded maps and videos load only after consent.
- Every choice, acceptance and privacy notice shown is a `consents` row, written by `policy_service`.
- Standard: [[[default:specifications-global/spec-legal-documents-and-consent|Legal Documents and Consent]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-legal-documents-and-consent.md).
- Packages: `settings/`, `server_settings/`.

### F-23 Reviews and testimonials
- After a completed appointment, an automatic task and a review-request email go to the customer.
- A review is a star rating (1–5) and a comment, linked to the contact, booking and provider.
- Reviews are hidden until the client approves them; approved reviews feed the homepage testimonials section.
- The client can also type in testimonials, marked as entered by the business; up to 10 testimonials are shown in total.
- Packages: `reviews/`, `server_reviews/`; the star rating is `StarRatingComponent` in `components/`.

### F-24 Customer portal
- CustomerLayout (section 9): My Dashboard, My Bookings, My Packages, My Quotes, My Invoices, My Reviews, Account.
- Customers set their password from the link in their first booking confirmation.
- Customers book, reschedule, pay invoices, accept or decline quotes and edit their profile; every server function filters to the signed-in customer's own records.
- No customer ticket system; customer contact goes through the contact form (F-06).
- Packages: `portal/`.

### F-25 Ease of use, in-app help and language
- Every feature carries a tooltip; the tooltip opens the feature's short help video in a pop-up, using the video component (F-09); per-user on/off setting.
- Help videos are held once per language in a Mybizz-owned Cloudflare R2 bucket at `media.mybizz.live` and played as direct video addresses; the pop-up plays the video in the app language. They set no cookies.
- App language: `business_profile.app_language` (`en` / `fr` / `pt` / `es` / `de` / `it`). English is complete at launch; a language is offered once its translation is complete and checked.
- Translation follows [[[default:specifications-global/spec-translation|Translation]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-translation.md):
  - Every fixed text has a phrase key. The Designer holds the key; each form calls `translate_form(self)` after `init_components`, and code uses `t(key, **values)`. Server functions return phrase keys with values, never finished text.
  - One phrase file per language (`en.py`, `fr.py`, `de.py`, `es.py`, `it.py`); Spanish is Spain's. Plural forms by each language's rule; dates, numbers and money through `formats.py`, on browser and server alike.
  - System emails, invoice, quote and statement PDFs, sample data and the public website's fixed text are in the app language. Client-edited email templates are stored per language (`email_templates.language`).
  - Anvil's Users emails (password reset, email confirmation, two-factor reset) carry all five languages, English first, set once in App 3.
  - Stripe Elements and PayPal's buttons are given the app language as `locale`.
  - AI translates every key from English, applying the glossary of product terms; a language is offered when every key exists in it (test ST-14). A wrong translation reported through Help is corrected in the phrase file and released to every client.
  - No right-to-left language is offered.
- Packages: `components/`, `shared/`.

### F-26 AI assistance
- Architecture and assists: `spec-ai-implementation.md`.
- One reusable AI helper component, `AIHelperComponent` in `components/` (`custom-component-requirements-matrix.md`), with trigger button, floating window, assist selector, dynamic working area, result area, copy, insert/replace/append into the host form.
- Context awareness: the host form passes its context; the helper preselects the matching assist.
- One shared AI request layer (`server_ai/`): prompt composition, model call, result return, error handling. Each assist is defined by identity, input fields, context mapping, prompt template and result handling.
- Two further AI functions use the same helper: the website-text assist in edit mode (F-06, F-08, F-21) and the social caption assist (F-21, `spec-sm-syndication.md`).
- All ten assists are built. Assists 9 (client sentiment summary) and 10 (booking and availability insights) run on the sample data (section 16) until the client clears it, then on the client's real data; on thin real data each says so and names what is needed.
- AI requests are routed through App 5, which holds Mybizz's AI provider keys and records usage per client. Client instances hold no Mybizz AI keys.
- The core application never depends on the AI: every AI failure returns a clear message and leaves the form usable.

### F-27 WhatsUp voice
- Speech-to-text: audio is sent to the server, transcribed by Groq Whisper (through App 5, as F-26), and passed into the shared AI request layer.
- Text-to-speech: browser SpeechSynthesis by default; Groq TTS for the natural-sounding voice.
- Voice tier 1: voice input to every assist. Tier 2: voice task creation. Tier 3: read-only single-answer queries (schedule and bookings, payments and revenue, tasks, customers, navigation) with spoken answers.
- Morning briefing: a brief-generation server function reads bookings, invoices, tasks and leads; a briefing prompt produces a 20–30 second spoken summary; per-user on/off setting.
- Conversational follow-up: a short session context held in the component state is sent with each request; the session ends on close, timeout or navigation away.
- Mobile voice view, opened from a home screen shortcut; no app install.
- Voice tier 4, voice form filling: one extraction prompt per supported form (booking, contact, invoice, task, quote, deal); extracted values mapped to form fields and matched to existing records; confirmation before save; a partly filled form with the missing fields highlighted, never an error.
- Voice tier 5, business intelligence by voice: the question is mapped to a fixed set of analysis functions that run in the instance's server code against its own tables and summary tables; the figures go to the AI layer with every person's name replaced by a placeholder label, and the instance puts the names back.
- Every voice query fails gracefully with a spoken message.

### F-28 Accounts
- Expenses (`expenses`, `expense_categories`): date, supplier, category, amount, tax, payment method, notes and a receipt image stored in R2 (`expenses/receipts/`).
- Reports, computed in server code: profit and loss by month (payments less refunds, against expenses and gateway fees), outstanding invoices, tax collected (invoices) and tax paid (expenses), customer statements (PDF).
- Export: for a chosen period, **Download for Wave**, **Download for Xero** or **Download for QuickBooks** writes one ZIP to R2 (`exports/`) and downloads it, holding the period's customers, invoices, and payments, refunds, gateway fees and expenses as a bank statement, each in that package's own import format, with a `README.txt` naming the import screens in order (`integration-architecture.md`, Accounting Export).
- Sample data is never exported.
- Packages: `accounts/`, `server_accounts/`.

### F-29 Data, backups and history
- Each client has one Cloudflare R2 bucket, in a free Cloudflare account in the client's own name; Mybizz reaches it as an invited member. The bucket's access keys are held in the client's Vault. Detail: `integration-architecture.md` (Client Storage).
- Folders of the bucket: `backups/daily/`, `backups/weekly/`, `history/{table}/`, `audit/{year}/{month}/`, `webhooks/{service}/{year}/{month}/`, `email/messages/{address}/{year}/{month}/`, `email/attachments/`, `expenses/receipts/`, `exports/`.
- Backups: scheduled background task exports every data table to the bucket daily; the last 7 daily and 4 weekly backups are kept.
- Webhook payloads (Stripe, PayPal, Amazon SES) are written to the bucket on receipt; the data tables keep only the current state they produce.
- Emails: bodies older than 90 days move to the bucket nightly and the row stays as an index; attachments are always in the bucket.
- Exit: Mybizz writes the full export, `encryption_key` and the decrypted Vault into the bucket, then leaves the client's Cloudflare account.
- History is not kept in the data tables; history records go to the bucket.
- Audit trail: the last 30 days stay in the audit table; a scheduled task moves older entries to the bucket.
- View: Settings → Data reads history from the bucket and displays it. Restore: Mybizz restores data from the bucket into the tables at the Owner's request. Export: all data as CSV at any time.
- Packages: `server_storage/`.

### F-30 Security and compliance
- Server-side enforcement of every role check; rate limiting; encrypted credentials (F-02); audit trail (F-01, F-29); data isolation (section 3).
- UK GDPR, the client's own privacy law and PCI DSS: [[[default:specifications-global/spec-regulatory-compliance-baseline|Regulatory Compliance Baseline (Specification)]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-regulatory-compliance-baseline.md). Card data never touches the instance; gateways handle it.

### F-31 Design system
- `m3-custom-theme` (dependency ID `UGGJBAZUZ74XZ7VU`), the full Material 3 theme built on Anvil's Material 3 theme, with the project deviations in `DESIGN.md`.
- No hardcoded colours: every colour comes from the Colour Scheme, referenced as `%color:Name%` or `var(--anvil-m3-…)`; translucent colours are derived with `color-mix()`.
- Eight palettes (`default`, `professional_blue`, `warm_coral`, `calm_teal`, `sophisticated_purple`, `sky_blue`, `forest_green`, `desert_rose`), each a complete Material 3 colour scheme in light and dark, held in `m3-custom-theme`; at startup App 1 calls `m3x_theming.set_palette(business_profile.palette)`, which sets the colour properties at runtime, so native and custom components change together.
- Dark mode follows the device setting on every screen ([[[default:adr-global/adr-dark-mode|Dark Mode]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-dark-mode.md) ADR); App 1 calls `m3x_theming.set_mode("system")` at startup, which applies the palette's dark scheme and switches when the device setting changes.
- Status colours `status-success`, `status-pending`, `status-error` are fixed platform colours; status is always shown with its word as well as its colour.
- Two contexts (management interface, public website) from one design system.

### F-32 Help, support tickets and feedback
- A Help item in the admin navigation opens a form: type (problem or feedback), subject, message, optional screenshot.
- `server_support/` sends the message to App 5 through the management endpoint with the instance's Bearer token.
- App 5 stores the ticket or feedback against the client, notifies the founder, and holds the reply thread; replies are shown in the client's Help view.
- Response targets: within 24 hours on business days; a problem that stops a client's business is acknowledged within 4 business hours.
- No customer data is sent with a ticket unless the client includes it.

### F-33 Hosting
- Section 4.

### F-34 Mybizz management app
- App 5, `mb-3-cs-app5`, built before the first paying client.
- Functions: client registry and registration (client reference numbers, credentials), provisioning (section 5) including the container and database, R2 bucket, Amazon SES identity and DNS records, usage monitoring (section 4), health monitoring, billing (monthly invoices to clients), release distribution, support tickets and feedback (F-32), the AI and voice gateway (F-26, F-27), the demo apps (F-36).
- App 5 holds Mybizz's AWS account access (SES, S3, SNS) and Mybizz's Cloudflare user.
- At-risk alerts: each client instance reports its last staff sign-in and last booking date with its usage report. App 5 alerts the founder when a client has no staff sign-in for 14 days, no bookings for 30 days, or a support ticket unanswered for 3 days.

### F-35 Sales pipeline, companies and quotes
- Companies (`companies`): a business customer; contacts link to it through `contacts.company_id`.
- Deals (`deals`): title, contact, company, owner, stage (`lead` / `qualified` / `proposal` / `negotiation` / `won` / `lost`), value, expected close date, linked quote; a board view by stage and a list view; Staff see the deals they own, enforced on the server.
- Quotes (`quotes`, `quote_items`): numbered `QT-{year}-{sequence}`, lines, the client's tax rate, validity date, PDF; sent by email with a link to `/quote/{token}`, where the customer accepts or declines; acceptance creates the invoice in the same server call, links it to the quote and moves a linked deal to `won`; a quote past its validity date becomes `expired` nightly.
- Quotes and deals appear on the contact's timeline (F-17).
- Packages: `sales/`, `server_sales/`.

### F-36 Demo apps
- Two instances of Mybizz CS on Mybizz's development account: `demo.mybizz.live` (sample data, section 16) and `try.mybizz.live` (empty), each with `config.demo_mode` set.
- A scheduled task resets both instances every night: every table is emptied, and the demo instance's sample data is loaded again.
- In demo mode, `email_service` sends every email to the signed-in visitor's own address, whatever its recipient; payments use each gateway's test keys and test cards; the Vault, Users and Permissions and Domain tabs are read-only.
- Visitors register for a demo sign-in with their email address; demo sign-ins are removed at the nightly reset.

## 14. Platform Constraints

- **Skulpt client runtime:** not all of the Python standard library works in the browser. Money and date logic lives in server modules only. See [[[default:adr-global/adr-anvil-platform-constraints|Anvil Platform Constraints and Design Boundaries]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-anvil-platform-constraints.md) ADR.
- **No native URL routing:** public pages use the routing dependency; the admin area uses lambda/Link/`open_form`.
- **Lazy-loaded rows:** never iterate a table without `.search()` or `.limit_to()`. See [[[default:adr-global/adr-data-access-patterns|Data Access Patterns and Query Limitations]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-data-access-patterns.md) ADR.
- **Server call latency:** every `anvil.server.call()` is an HTTP round trip; user-facing flows minimise calls.
- **No WebSocket push:** real-time updates use client-side timer polling. See [[[default:adr-global/adr-real-time-and-background-tasks|Real-Time Updates and Background Task Architecture]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-real-time-and-background-tasks.md) ADR.

## 16. Sample Data

Specified in `spec-ai-implementation.md` (Sample Data).

- Provisioning loads three months of sample data for the client's trade, in the client's system currency and app language, into every business table, and computes the summary tables from it.
- Every sample row is recorded in `sample_rows` (table name, row id).
- Sample contacts use `example.com` addresses. The email, reminder, campaign and payment services and the accounts export skip every sample record.
- A banner on every screen shows while `sample_rows` holds rows.
- **Clear sample data** (Owner only, on the banner and in Settings, with a confirmation dialog) runs a background task: delete every recorded row, empty the links from real records to sample records, empty `sample_rows`, recompute the summary tables, record the action in `activity_log`.
- Packages: `server_settings/` (`sample_data_service`: loading, the clearing task and the banner state).
