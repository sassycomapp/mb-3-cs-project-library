# Mybizz CS — Scaffold Specification

The structure of App 1: its packages, forms, modules, navigation and startup.

**Standard:** [[[default:specifications-global/spec-anvil-platform-standards]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-anvil-platform-standards.md)

**Authority:** where this document differs from `mb-3-cs-architecture-reference.md` on a technical fact, the architecture reference is correct. Feature numbers (F-01 to F-36) are those of `mb-3-cs-concept.md`. Detail that has its own home is linked, not repeated:

| Subject | Home |
|---|---|
| Tables and fields | `docs-standard-local/authoritative-schema.md` |
| Custom components | `docs-standard-local/custom-component-requirements-matrix.md` |
| Design system | `docs-local/DESIGN.md`, `docs-local/palette-tokens.md` |
| Calendar forms | `specifications-local/spec-calendar-feature.md` |
| AI, voice and sample data | `specifications-local/spec-ai-implementation.md` |
| Email and the Team Inbox | `specifications-local/spec-team-inbox.md` |
| Social media sharing | `specifications-local/spec-sm-syndication.md` |
| Shared client state | `docs-standard-local/globals-contract.md` |
| Screen building rules | `spec-ui-standards` (project-library-global) and the screen requirements in `ui\` |

## Package Structure

### Rules

- Feature-based packages. A package that exists is never renamed or merged; a new feature gets a new package.
- A form is a folder holding `form_template.yaml` and `__init__.py`. `form_template.yaml` is changed only in the Anvil editor, never by an agent.
- A server package is a folder holding `__init__.py` and its modules (`.py` files).
- Imports between modules are relative (`from ...shared import formatting_utils`), never by the app's package name: in a client instance the code runs from `master_template`'s package, so an import by App 1's package name fails there.
- All money, date and time logic is in server modules (Skulpt, reference section 14).
- Forms marked **(local)** are used inside one parent form only and live in that parent's folder.
- No visible words are typed into the Designer: the Designer holds phrase keys, and each form calls `translate_form(self)` after `init_components` (F-25, [[[default:specifications-global/spec-translation|Translation]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-translation.md)).

The four homepage templates, two blog list templates, three blog post templates and three landing page templates are the 12 page templates of `DESIGN.md` (Template and Layout Architecture). Each is a form in its parent's folder, loaded into the parent's content panel by the parent's template field (`business_profile.homepage_template`, `business_profile.blog_list_view`, `blog_posts.template`, `landing_pages.template_type`).

├── server_reviews/       review_service, testimonial_service
├── server_ai/            ai_request_layer, assists, voice_service, briefing_service

                          email_service, export_service, retry_queue, demo_service
```

- `vault_service` is the only module that reads the `encryption_key` Anvil Secret (F-02). It holds the encryption and decryption; no other module encrypts or decrypts.
- `payment_service` is the single gateway-agnostic payment service; client code and other server modules call it, never a gateway module directly (F-15).
- `ai_request_layer` is the single route for every AI and speech request, through App 5 (F-26, F-27).
- `r2_service` is the only module that talks to Cloudflare R2 (F-29).
- `email_service` is the only module that sends email; every email goes through Amazon SES; in demo mode it delivers to the signed-in visitor only (F-18, F-36).
- `inbound_endpoint` and `events_endpoint` receive SES's notifications; `unsubscribe_endpoint` handles the unsubscribe link and one-click unsubscribe; `blog_image_endpoint` serves published posts' featured images (`spec-sm-syndication.md`).
- `management_endpoints` holds the HTTP endpoints App 5 calls; `webhook_handlers` holds the gateway webhook endpoints.
- Every `*_tasks` module holds that package's background tasks; the schedule is in `integration-architecture.md` (Background Tasks).

### Server function pattern

- Every callable function carries a role decorator from `server_auth/rbac` (Owner, Manager, Admin, Staff, Customer); the server is the enforcement, never the interface (F-01).
- A function used by a customer filters every query to the signed-in customer's own records (F-24).
- Every function returns `{'success': True, 'data': result}` or `{'success': False, 'error': message}`.
- Every public function has type hints and a docstring with Args, Returns and Raises, and logs as `observability-requirements.md` requires.
- Any operation expected to run longer than 22 seconds is an `@anvil.server.background_task`.

---

## Custom Component Conventions

A custom component is a reusable element that the Anvil Material 3 theme does not provide and that is used in more than one place. An element used in one place only is a local form in its parent's folder.

- The twelve shared custom components, where each is used and its implementation notes: `custom-component-requirements-matrix.md`.
- Every shared custom component lives in `client_code/components/`, takes its settings as properties set by the host form, and uses only the tokens, typography, spacing and roles in `DESIGN.md`.
- Components inside a custom component are only those [[[default:specifications-global/spec-ui-standards|UI Standards]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-ui-standards.md) allows; browser features are reached through `anvil.js`, never `eval`.
- Not built: animated button, card, link and image components; an onboarding palette form; chip components (matrix, Not built).

---

## Database Schema

The tables, their columns, types and allowed values are in `authoritative-schema.md`: 70 tables. The changes that bring App 1's tables to that schema, and the prompts that apply them, are in `schema-migration-log.md`. Every schema change is made in App 1, recorded in `schema-migration-log.md`, and applied to App 3.

### Rules

- One client instance has one database. No table carries a client or instance column; isolation comes from the instance (reference section 3).
- All datetimes are stored in UTC and shown in the business's IANA time zone (`business_profile.timezone`).
- Amounts are stored in the system currency (F-16).
- Bookings, invoices, orders, payments, quotes and expenses are never deleted; their status changes.
- History, backups, webhook payloads, old email bodies, attachments and receipts are kept in the client's R2 bucket, not in the tables (F-29).
- Credentials are kept only in `vault`, encrypted.
- `activity_log` is the audit table.

---

## M3 Component Standards

- Every screen is built to [[[default:specifications-global/spec-ui-standards|UI Standards]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-ui-standards.md), by the method of [[[default:specifications-global/mo-ui-production|UI Production Method]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/mo-ui-production.md), and to `DESIGN.md`.
- Component names follow [[[default:specifications-global/spec-nomenclature|Nomenclature]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-nomenclature.md); `Text` components use the prefix `text_`.
- A failed validation sets the input's `error` property and shows the message in its supporting text; both are cleared when the input is valid.
- Settings forms that read and write through their own server calls use no data bindings.
- Multi-step flows (onboarding, booking, order) keep the selections in `self.item` or in `globals.py` (`globals-contract.md`) and submit to the server once, at the last step.

---

## Navigation Architecture

| Area | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Admin area | `AdminLayout` (`NavigationRailLayout`), the layout's `NavigationLink` components with lambda click handlers, `open_form()` |
| Customer portal | `CustomerLayout` (`NavigationDrawerLayout`), the same mechanism |
| Public website | `PublicLayout`, Anvil Routing (`@router.route`) |

- Each page form names its layout in the Designer. Opening a page is `open_form('package.FormName')`; the layout stays.
- Click handlers capture the loop variable: `lambda e, fn=form_name: self._nav_click(fn)`.
- `navigate_to` and `HTMLTemplate` are not used ([[[default:adr-global/adr-navigation-lambda-link-open-form|Navigation Standard: Lambda/Link/open_form]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-navigation-lambda-link-open-form.md) ADR, [[[default:adr-global/adr-htmltemplate-use|HTMLTemplate Use]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/adr-global/adr-htmltemplate-use.md) ADR).
- The menu items, their order and who sees them are defined in `mb-3-cs-architecture-reference.md` section 9. The forms behind them:

### AdminLayout menu → forms

| Menu item | Form | Shown to |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | `dashboard.DashboardForm` | all staff roles |

Every public route sets its title, description and Open Graph tags in `Route.meta` (`spec-sm-syndication.md`). The HTTP endpoints `/_/api/email/inbound`, `/_/api/email/events`, `/_/api/email/unsubscribe` and `/_/api/blog-image/{slug}` are served by the server modules above.

## Startup Configuration

The startup form is `auth.LoginForm` (`anvil.yaml`: `startup: {module: auth.LoginForm, type: form}`). Its `__init__` routes before `init_components()`:

1. Signed in as Owner, Manager, Admin or Staff → `open_form('dashboard.DashboardForm')` and `return`; while `business_profile.onboarding_status` is `in_progress`, the Owner goes to `onboarding.OnboardingForm` instead.
2. Signed in as Customer → `open_form('portal.MyDashboardForm')` and `return`.
3. A public address → the routing dependency opens the route's form.
4. Not signed in → the sign-in form is shown.

At startup the palette module applies `business_profile.palette` and starts the device light/dark watch (`palette-tokens.md`).

### Users service (set in the Anvil editor; agents never write `anvil.yaml`)

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Sign-in method | Email and password | F-01 |
| Sign-up | Off | Owners are created at provisioning, staff by invitation, customers by their first booking |
| Confirm email | On | F-01 |
| Remember me | 30 minutes | Matches the 30-minute session rule (F-01, UF-38) |
| Require 2-factor authentication | On (`require_mfa: true`); authenticator apps and security keys (FIDO2) allowed; "Allow 2-factor reset by email" on | Every account holder signs in with a second factor, the Owner with FIDO2 (F-01); the Vault's own TOTP is in addition (F-02) |
| Secure passwords | Required | F-01 |
| User table | `users` | |

### Other services

- Data Tables.
- Email: Anvil's Email service with **Use Custom Mail Server** set to the SES SMTP endpoint (`email-smtp.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`, port 587), its password from the Vault's `ses_smtp_password`, set at provisioning; it carries only the Users service's sign-in, confirmation and reset email. Every other email goes through `server_shared/email_service` and the SES API (`spec-team-inbox.md`).

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Dependency ID | Version | Package name |
|---|---|---|---|
| Material 3 Theme | `4UK6WHQ6UX7AKELK` | `v1.2.6` | `m3` |
| Routing | `3PIDO5P3H4VPEMPL` | `v0.6.1` | `routing` |

- Versions are pinned. A version change is a release with its own tests.
- App 3 and every client instance depend on `master_template` (App 2), as `mb-3-cs-architecture-reference.md` section 1 sets out.
- **Anvil Secret:** `encryption_key` only, used only by `vault_service`. Set once per instance at provisioning and never changed.
- **Native libraries:** `anvil.yaml` loads `@floating-ui/dom@1` from `cdn.jsdelivr.net` in `head_html`. Its purpose is not recorded. It is checked against the M3 theme's own requirements, then kept with its reason recorded here, or removed. No other external script is loaded.
- **Runtime:** server Python 3.14 (`python314`) in every app; packages in each app's `requirements.txt` (`boto3`); client version 3.
