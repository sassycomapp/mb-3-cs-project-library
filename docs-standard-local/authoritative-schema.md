# Mybizz CS — Authoritative Database Schema

Every table and column of a Mybizz CS client instance: name, type and allowed values.

**Authority:** this document is the single home of the schema. Where a technical fact here differs from `mb-3-cs-architecture-reference.md`, the architecture reference is correct. Feature numbers (F-01 to F-36) are those of `mb-3-cs-concept.md`. The changes that bring App 1's tables to this schema are in `schema-migration-log.md`.

**Total tables:** 70
**Platform:** Anvil Data Tables. Every table has `client: none` and `server: full`: the browser never reads a table directly; server functions return rows and results.

---

## Rules

- **One instance, one client.** No table carries a client or instance column; isolation comes from the instance (reference section 3).
- **UTC.** Every `datetime` is stored in UTC and shown in `business_profile.timezone` (an IANA time zone).
- **One currency.** Every amount is in `business_profile.system_currency` (F-16).
- **Money in cents.** Every amount is stored as a whole number of cents of the system currency, as [[[default:specifications-global/spec-anvil-platform-standards|Anvil Platform Standards]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-anvil-platform-standards.md) requires: Anvil's `number` column is floating-point, so decimal amounts would round wrongly. Amounts are converted to the currency's units only for display.
- **Never deleted.** Rows of `bookings`, `orders`, `invoice`, `payments`, `quotes` and `expenses` are never deleted; their status changes.
- **History outside the tables.** Backups, history, webhook payloads, audit entries older than 30 days, email bodies older than 90 days, email attachments and expense receipts are kept in the client's R2 bucket (F-29).
- **Credentials only in the Vault**, encrypted.
- **Names** follow [[[default:specifications-global/spec-nomenclature|Nomenclature]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-nomenclature.md). A link column is named `{target}_id`, or in the plural for a multiple link. A link to a provider (a staff user who delivers services) is always `provider_id`. A link to a bookable room or piece of equipment is always `resource_id`.
- **Allowed values** are lowercase strings, written in this document as `value1` / `value2`. Code compares against these exact strings.
- **Standard columns.** Every table has `created_at`. Every table whose rows are edited after creation has `updated_at`. Every core table (one holding a business record a client works with) has `metadata`, a simpleObject for client-level attributes; `bookings.metadata` holds the client-defined intake answers.
