# Mybizz CS — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

What the product does, for whom, and how its success is measured.

**Standard:** [[[default:docs-standard-global/docstd-product-requirements-document]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/docs-standard-global/docstd-product-requirements-document.md)

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-10-31
**Author:** Mybizz founder
**Derived from:** `business-requirements-document.md`. The features are those of `mb-3-cs-concept.md` section 7 (F-01 to F-36); the flows are those of `user-flows.md` (UF-01 to UF-44); the technical specification of each feature is `mb-3-cs-architecture-reference.md` section 12. Where this document differs from those, they are correct.

**Certainty tags:** `[CLEAR]` / `[PARTIAL]` / `[INFERRED]` / `[MISSING]`, as in the BRD.

## 1. Overview

Mybizz CS is an online business platform for consulting businesses and service businesses. Each client receives its own application instance on its own domain: a public website with booking, ordering and lead capture; an admin area for the client's staff to run bookings, orders, packages, time, sales, invoices, accounts, customers, the Team Inbox, marketing, content and settings; a customer portal for the client's customers; an AI helper on every relevant form; and WhatsUp, a voice view on the phone. The app runs in the client's chosen language. Mybizz runs every client from its own management app (App 5), which provisions, monitors, bills, supports and updates them, and offers prospects two demo apps.

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement | Certainty |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | A user-facing flow makes the fewest server calls: the booking flow at most three round trips; dashboards read pre-computed tables; any operation over 22 seconds runs as a background task; a server call shows a progress indicator and times out after 30 seconds with a retry | [CLEAR] |
| Security | Vault for every credential, with TOTP step-up on every view; the only Anvil Secret is `encryption_key`; role checks on the server for every function; customers filtered to their own records; Bearer token per instance for App 5; rate-limited sign-in and lockout | [CLEAR] |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA in every palette, light and dark; keyboard operation; visible focus; status never by colour alone; reduced motion respected | [CLEAR] |
| Availability | Each client instance runs in Mybizz CS's DigitalOcean cluster, with a standby database node: 99.95% monthly; one region is a single point of failure, covered by the rebuild procedure in `deployment-procedures.md`; nightly backups to the client's R2 bucket | [CLEAR] |
| Timezone handling | UTC storage, display-time conversion, one IANA time zone per instance | [CLEAR] |
| Currency handling | One system currency, locked after the first booking or invoice; optional display currency per service, display only | [CLEAR] |
| Color/theming compliance | Anvil M3 theme with the project deviations of `DESIGN.md`; no hardcoded colour anywhere; eight palettes and dark mode through `m3x_theming` and the theme's colour properties | [CLEAR] |
| Data protection | UK GDPR, the client's own privacy law and PCI DSS per [[[default:specifications-global/spec-regulatory-compliance-baseline\|Regulatory Compliance Baseline]]](C:/dev/project-library-global/specifications-global/spec-regulatory-compliance-baseline.md); no customer personal data stored in App 5: the heartbeat and usage report carry none, and AI and speech requests pass through App 5 to Groq unstored, with Groq's Zero Data Retention switched on | [CLEAR] |
| Capacity | 1 GiB container memory per client; the cluster sized to the client count; 100 clients in total | [CLEAR] |
| Email delivery | Every email from a client's domain signed with DKIM and aligned for DMARC; bounces and complaints suppressed automatically; one SES tenant per client | [CLEAR] |
| Language | Five app languages; no screen text typed into the Designer | [CLEAR] |
| Support | Problem that stops a client's business acknowledged within 4 business hours; other tickets within 24 hours on business days | [CLEAR] |

---

## 7. Out of Scope

No feature of Mybizz CS is deferred to a later release. Voice tier 4 (voice form filling) and voice tier 5 (business intelligence by voice) are built in this release, on the sample data, as `spec-ai-implementation.md` specifies. `[CLEAR]`

---

## 8. Dependencies

- **Multi-instance model:** every client instance runs the release image, built from `master_template` (App 2), which receives each release from App 1 (Step 42), and App 3. Every later release, with its new tables and columns, is delivered by App 5's Release action. `[CLEAR]`
- **App 5** must be built and running before the first paying client: registration, provisioning, the AI and voice gateway, the Help channel and at-risk alerts depend on it. `[CLEAR]`
- **Anvil:** Mybizz's Business account for Apps 1, 2, 3 and 5; the Anvil App Server for client instances; background tasks and scheduled tasks; HTTP endpoints; the Material 3 theme and Routing dependencies. `[CLEAR]`
- **DigitalOcean:** App Platform containers, Managed PostgreSQL with a standby node, Container Registry (`spec-client-instance-hosting`). `[CLEAR]`
- **Outside services:** Stripe, PayPal, Amazon SES, Cloudflare R2 and DNS, Groq (`integration-architecture.md`). SES production access for Mybizz's AWS account (BRD AC-14). `[PARTIAL]`
- **The client's own domain**, carrying the website and every email address. `[CLEAR]`

---

## 9. Open Questions

| # | Question | Settled at | Certainty |
|---|---|---|---|
| OQ-2 | Can an app schedule a background task of its dependency and serve its dependency's HTTP endpoints? | Proved in App 1 before Step 31 | [MISSING] |

---

## 10. Success Metrics

The BRD's KPIs (section 8) apply. For this release in particular:
