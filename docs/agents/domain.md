# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Two-repo architecture

This application spans two repos:

- **`mb-3-cs-project-library`** — planning, documentation, ADRs, wireframes, design artefacts.
- **`mb-3-cs`** — live application code (Python/Anvil). Built on Anvil.works.

Both repos apply to the same application. When a skill needs implementation context, read from `mb-3-cs`. When it needs architectural decisions or design context, read from this repo.

## Before exploring, read these

- **[[CONTEXT|mb-3-cs (Mybizz Consulting Services)]]** — domain glossary and key concepts (create lazily via `/domain-modeling` when needed).
- **`adr-local/`** — Architecture Decision Records for this project.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in [[CONTEXT|mb-3-cs (Mybizz Consulting Services)]]. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts the [[adr-client-instance-architecture|Client Instance Architecture]] ADR (client instance architecture) — but worth reopening because…_
